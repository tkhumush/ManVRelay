# NIP-XX: Relay Management Dashboard

`draft` `optional`

This NIP describes a web-based dashboard application for managing Nostr relays using existing NIPs.

## Overview

This application provides a comprehensive interface for relay operators to manage their Nostr relays. It integrates with existing NIPs to provide functionality for:

- Viewing relay information (NIP-11)
- Managing user access (NIP-86)
- Moderating events (NIP-86)
- Configuring relay settings (NIP-86)
- Authenticating with NIP-07 browser extensions

## Features

### Relay Information Display
The dashboard displays relay metadata according to NIP-11, including:
- Basic relay information (name, description, icon, banner)
- Supported NIPs
- Server limitations
- Fee schedules
- Retention policies
- Community preferences

### User Management
Using NIP-86 relay management API, operators can:
- Ban users by public key
- Allow specific users
- View lists of banned and allowed users
- Add reasons for user actions

### Event Moderation
The dashboard provides event moderation capabilities:
- View events flagged for moderation
- Approve or reject events
- Ban specific events by ID
- View lists of banned events

### Relay Configuration
Operators can configure relay metadata:
- Update relay name and description
- Change relay icon
- Manage allowed event kinds
- Block IP addresses

### Authentication
The application uses NIP-07 browser extensions for authentication:
- Secure signing of management requests
- NIP-98 HTTP authentication for API calls
- No private key handling in the application

## Implementation

The dashboard is implemented as a React web application that:
1. Connects to relays via WebSocket for real-time data
2. Uses HTTP requests with NIP-98 authentication for management operations
3. Provides a responsive interface for both desktop and mobile use
4. Includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Security Considerations

- All management operations require NIP-07 authentication
- Private keys never leave the user's browser extension
- API calls use NIP-98 signed authentication headers
- CORS headers must be properly configured on the relay

## Dependencies

This implementation relies on:
- NIP-07: Browser extension signing capability
- NIP-11: Relay information document
- NIP-86: Relay management API
- NIP-98: HTTP authentication

## Example Usage

1. User visits the dashboard URL
2. Connects their NIP-07 compatible browser extension
3. Enters their relay URL
4. Authenticates using their Nostr keys
5. Manages relay settings through the web interface

The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for relay operators who may not be comfortable with command-line tools or direct API access.
